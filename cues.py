Apartment 

 

1. Surveillance Footage: 

 

   - August 26: 

     - 10:00 PM: Daikou Kouhei entered the apartment. 

 

   - August 27:  

     - 8:20 AM: Machiyama Susumu entered the apartment.   

     - 9:03 AM: Machiyama Susumu exited the apartment.   

     - 9:30 AM: Konda Masami entered the apartment.   

     - 9:45 AM: Konda Masami exited the apartment.   

     - 10:00 AM: Daikou Kouhei exited the apartment. 

 

2. Surveillance footage from the main entrance of the apartment shows that Sugiura Haruichirou had not left the building for half a month since his return in mid-August. During this time, no mailman had entered the apartment. 

 

3. The 4-story apartment building has no rooftop access and only one entrance. The building’s smooth walls made climbing impossible. Each floor contained two units facing each other. On the 4th floor, Sugiura and Kouhei lived in adjacent units, with their study room windows only about half 3.5 feet apart. The detective attempted to climb between the windows but noted it would require considerable physical effort. 

 

Study 

 

1. There was a fingerprint-locked safe beneath the desk that was opened using Sugiura's fingerprint, but it was found to be empty. The safe could also be unlocked with Konda Masami's fingerprint. 

 

2. The temperature today was 100F, and the window in Sugiura's study was left unlocked and open for ventilation. 

 

3. A folder marked with Sugiura Haruichirou's name contained photos of Konda Masami taken over the past six months, as well as an unexamined USB drive. 

 

4. An envelope held the threatening letters Sugiura had received over the past month. The tone of the letters indicated they were likely from organized crime. 

 

Daikou Kouhei 

 

1. After the arm injury, Kouhei repeatedly harassed Sugiura in the apartment, demanding compensation for medical expenses, but Sugiura consistently refused. For the past two weeks, Sugiura had not only isolated himself but also refused to open the door for Kouhei. Other residents who tried to check on him were also unable to get inside. 

 

2. According to other residents, two months ago, Kouhei and Sugiura had a physical altercation in the hallway, during which Kouhei fell down the stairs and severely sprained his left arm. His recovery has been poor, and he still has limited use of the arm. 

 

3. In Kouhei's briefcase, a work notebook was found with handwriting that matches the threatening letters. 

 

4. Kouhei's bank account shows a transfer of 500,000 yen from Sugiura two years ago. That same month, Kouhei made a purchase of 500,000 yen. 

 

Konda Masami 

 

1. A key to Sugiura's apartment was discovered in Masami's home, with wear marks indicating it had been used for at least a year. 

 

2. Since their breakup six months ago, Masami and Sugiura had occasional phone contact, with the most recent call recorded at 10:30 PM on August 26th. 

 

3. Masami's handbag bag contained a receipt for a fruit knife purchased at a supermarket near her home at 8:30 AM. 

 

4. Masami now resides an hour's drive from Sugiura's apartment. 

 

Machiyama Susumu 

 

1. Neighbors of Susumu reported that debt collectors had recently begun threatening him over overdue payments. 

 

2. Payroll records reveal that Sugiura had not paid Machiyama Susumu for almost two months. 

 

3. Each day Susumu arrived to clean the apartment, he brought along an 18-inch cleaning bag filled with tools, which always seemed heavy. 

 

4. Machiyama Susumu's phone contained a loan app showing an 8 million yen loan taken out two years ago, with no payments made in the past two months. """
