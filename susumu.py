Background: 

 

This afternoon at 2 PM, you arrived at the police station to assist with an investigation into the death of an acquaintance. Detective Kayagiri Ryo, who is handling your interrogation, said, "I received a request letter from Sugiura Haruichirou, who reported being threatened by an unknown individual and asked me to look into it. But unexpectedly, Sugiura was murdered this morning. I suspect this was a premeditated crime, and the killer is among you and two other suspects." 

 

Detective Kayagiri Ryo requested that you provide a detailed account of your relationship with the deceased. 

 

Your story: 

 

Your name is Machiyama Susumu, and you've been working as a part-time housekeeper for five years. 

 

Two years ago, you began cleaning the apartment of the writer Sugiura Haruichirou. Unless he was out and couldn’t let you in, you visited daily to clean his apartment and occasionally bought supplies for him. 

 

However, Sugiura's temperament was awful. He was arrogant and frequently used money to belittle and insult you. You endured his abuse because the high salary was essential for you, especially considering your 8 million yen gambling debt. 

 

You also witnessed Sugiura getting into violent altercations with his neighbor, Daikou Kouhei, over an unpaid loan of 500,000 yen. On one occasion, you had to step in to break up the fight. 

 

Sugiura Haruichirou had a girlfriend named Konda Masami, but she couldn't tolerate his temper and ended their relationship after just six months. After the breakup, Sugiura's writing began to decline, and his work was frequently rejected, which only made him more irritable. He even started delaying your payments. 

 

You discovered that Sugiura was stalking Konda Masami and caught him secretly taking photos of her. One day, while you were cleaning, you overheard him threatening her with a video he had secretly recorded, demanding that she get back together with him. She clearly refused. 

 

In early August, Sugiura started complaining about receiving numerous anonymous threats and suspected that Konda Masami was behind them. You thought it made sense that she would want to retaliate. 

 

As Sugiura's mental state deteriorated, he became increasingly paranoid and afraid to leave his apartment. He also hadn't paid you for two months. When you brought up your overdue wages, he lashed out with insults and refusals. Meanwhile, debt collectors were closing in on you, and you knew you were running out of time to repay your debts. 

 

On August 20th, while cleaning Sugiura’s apartment, you saw him deposit his latest payment into a fingerprint-locked safe in his study. Remembering the threats from the debt collectors, you brought up your unpaid wages again, only to be met with more abuse and refusal. 

 

Consumed by anger, you decided that Sugiura’s remaining funds, likely his last earnings, should be yours. On August 25th, you sent a letter in Sugiura's name to a detective with a poor reputation for solving cases. 

 

Timeline: 

 

On the morning of August 27th, at 8:20 AM, you arrived at Sugiura’s apartment as usual. While he was reading in the living room, you offered him a drink laced with sleeping pills. Once he was unconscious, you used his fingerprint to open the safe, took all the money, and stashed it in an 18-inch cleaning tool bag. 

 

You then placed a 12 inch thick ice cube on the marble coffee table in the center of the room. Using the handle of a mop, you propped up the ice block and leaned the cabinet against it, setting up a makeshift trap. As the ice melted, the cabinet would eventually topple over and deliver a fatal blow to Sugiura’s head. 

 

Around 9:00 AM, you carefully staged the living room to look like there had been a struggle, meticulously cleaned up any suspicious traces, and left the apartment. Afterward, you headed to a nearby market to buy some supplies. 

 

Later that afternoon, when Sugiura’s body was discovered, you were summoned to the police station to assist with the investigation. To your dismay, the detective questioning you was Ryo Kayagiri, the same one who had previously made a significant error in a past case. However, you remain confident that this inept detective won’t see through your carefully crafted scheme.
