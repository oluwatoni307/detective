Background: 

 

This afternoon at 2 PM, you arrived at the police station to assist with an investigation into the death of an acquaintance. Detective Kayagiri Ryo, who is handling your interrogation, said, "I received a request letter from Sugiura Haruichirou, who reported being threatened by an unknown individual and asked me to look into it. But unexpectedly, Sugiura was murdered this morning. I suspect this was a premeditated crime, and the killer is among you and two other suspects." 

 

Detective Kayagiri Ryo requested that you provide a detailed account of your relationship with the deceased. 

 

Your story:  

 

Your name is Konda Masami, a social media influencer who earns a living creating dance videos from home. 

 

You are a moderately well-known internet content creator. About a year ago, you met Sugiura Haruichirou, a writer, and quickly fell in love. You moved into his apartment to live together. 

 

Sugiura had a routine of locking his cash and valuables in a safe at home. As a sign of trust, he registered your fingerprint with the safe, which made you feel both delighted and secure. 

 

After moving in, Sugiura's neighbor, Daikou Kouhei, made a derogatory comment when he saw you, suggesting that your relationship wouldn't last. Confused, you mentioned this to Sugiura and discovered that the neighbor owed him 500,000 yen and hadn't repaid it. Their relationship was strained, and hearing this, you couldn’t help but dismiss Daikou Kouhei. 

 

There was also a housekeeper named Machiyama Susumu who had been working for Sugiura for a long time. Unless you and Sugiura were out and couldn’t open the door, Susumu would come daily to clean the apartment and occasionally bring supplies that Sugiura needed. 

 

Over time, the presence of the housekeeper, Susumu Machiyama, revealed another side of Sugiura. He appeared to disdain those who performed physical labor, often mocking and insulting Susumu with sarcastic comments while he cleaned. His temper was notoriously bad. Susumu likely endured this behavior only because Sugiura paid him well. 

 

After six months of dating Sugiura, you could no longer tolerate his neurotic behavior and occasional fits of rage. After a heated argument during which he physically assaulted you, you decided to break up and moved out of the apartment. 

 

However, Sugiura began harassing you. He resorted to stalking and threats in a desperate attempt to get you back. He even claimed to have secretly recorded a video of the two of you together. Furious, you called him and had a major argument. You had no intention of yielding to his manipulations. 

 

To escape the harassment, you started dating a new boyfriend who was involved with the Yakuza. In early August, you brought him to Sugiura’s place to intimidate him, and he eventually stopped his stalking and harassment. 

 

On the night of August 26th, just as you were about to sleep, you received a call from Sugiura. He made some bizarre threats and once again warned that he would release the indecent video if you continued to harass and threaten him. Confused and frustrated, you dismissed him as a madman. After another heated phone argument, you ended the call. Concerned that the video might actually be made public, you spent a sleepless night, gradually growing more determined to confront Sugiura. 

 

The next morning, after a restless night, you decided to confront him directly. On your way to his apartment, you bought a fruit knife at a nearby market and put it in your bag, thinking that if he tried anything, you’d be prepared to fight him to the end. 

 

Timeline: 

 

At 9:30 AM, you arrived at Sugiura’s apartment, knocking on the door forcefully. After a long wait with no response, you tried calling him, but he didn’t answer. You then recalled that you might still have the keys from when you lived there, but you had left them at home and didn’t bring them with you. 

 

After waiting 15 minutes with no response from Sugiura, you began to calm down. Deciding not to try contacting him again, you left the apartment and returned home feeling disheartened. The fruit knife you bought earlier remained unused for its intended purpose. 

 

It wasn’t until the afternoon that you were unexpectedly summoned by the police and learned that Sugiura had been murdered in his home that morning. You went to the police station to cooperate with the investigation, only to discover that the detective questioning you was Ryo Kayagiri—the same detective who had previously made a serious error in a case. If he dares to wrongfully accuse you of being the murderer this time, you vow to retaliate fiercely.
